# ////QUESTION 1:.  Make a function that encrypts a given input with these steps:
# Input: "apple"
# Step 1: Reverse the input: "elppa"
# Step 2: Replace all vowels using the following chart:
# a => 0
# e => 1
# i => 2
# o => 2
# u => 3
# # "1lpp0"
# Step 3: Add "aca" to the end of the word: "1lpp0aca"
# Output: "1lpp0aca"////

#///////// QUESTION 5: Write a Python Program to Display the multiplication Table?//////
# num = 2
# n = 1
# while n <= 10:
#     print(num*n, end=" ")

# QUESTION 7: What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?
#  Dict:
# unordered container of key,value pair, The elements are accessed via key-values.
#  List: unordered container of different objects. The elements are accessed via indexing

# //////Q8. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?////
# class object declared at the class level and instance object defining at init level. we use instance method when objects
# has different character. when object has same character we use class method.

# /////Q9. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?
#   __init__ method is a constructor use to initialize the objects
